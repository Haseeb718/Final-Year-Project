# Final-Year-ProjectThis project is a Solar Panel and Inverter Monitoring System alongside a mobile appli-
cation, this also includes is a designed inverter. The collected data undergoes processing
and is displayed on a mobile app, allowing users to engage in real-time monitoring and
remote-control functions. The monitoring system effortlessly incorporates hardware
components and sensors to gather crucial data from solar panels and the crafted inverter.
The application is a user-friendly interface. The inverter design contributes to improved
system efficiency. By combining effective monitoring of the inverter, this project plays
a role in promoting sustainable solar energy demand. This provides users with practical
understanding for proper energy management and the ease of use of renewable energy.
